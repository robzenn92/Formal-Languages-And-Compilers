\chapter*{Abstract}
My name is Roberto Zen and I am studying for my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Trento.
I decided to write this handout in order to help my mates to pass the Formal Languages and Compiler exam. This is NOT the official handout of the course, so it could contain some errors.
I hope it be usefull for my mates in order to avoid to make common mistakes in the exam.
