\chapter*{Abstract}
My name is Roberto Zen and I am studying for my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Trento.
I decided to write these lecture notes in order to help my mates to pass the Formal Languages and Compiler exam. These are NOT the official lecture notes of the course, so it could contain some errors.
I hope it be helpful for my mates in order to avoid to make common mistakes in the exam.
